# Siebel-CRM
A short description of the Oracle Siebel CRM Tool

## What is CRM and Why?
CRM is a Customer Relationship Management, it's primary goal is to increase customer loyalty and in turn improve business profitability.
Nowadays 70% of the web application holds a CRM tool in defining the architecture of an application.

## Why to relay on CRM as the purpose is also serving by middle-ware technologies?
Below are the main important points, why we are using CRM tools :
1. An application integrated with CRM will mostly relay writing the logic only in CRM, not in middleware.
2. Middle ware will be only used to serve the need to process the files in CRM Understandable Languages.
3. Siebel CRM accepts the data in XML and JSON requests, not as a file.
4. Middleware like java,.net, python is used to transfer the files into XML or JSON and transfer it to CRM.
5. An added advantage of CRM is, it handles the logic required by the client and provide a separate interface to the customer representive to serve the customer needs.

## Siebel CRM Architecture :

Siebel CRM is a three-layered Architecture as below :

- [User Interface Layer](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B40099_02/books/ConfigApps/ConfigApps_OverviewArch5.html)

- [Business Layer](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B40099_02/books/ConfigApps/ConfigApps_OverviewArch6.html)

- [Data Layer](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B40099_02/books/ConfigApps/ConfigApps_OverviewArch7.html)

As every application has three-layer Architecture, Siebel itself contains a three-layered architecture.

> User interface will be responsible for creating and designing a beautiful UI by using HTML, CSS files.

> Business layer is where the whole logic will be handled by using the javascript language.

> Data Layer handles the data of the customer's and store in the oracle database.

Siebel CRM has a large domain over the Loyalty providing it to the customers. But slowly started losing its market nowadays as many more CRM's like salesforce came into the picture and all the data is stored in the cloud but not with the Siebel still it's using manual servers to store the code.
