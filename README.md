# Siebel-CRM
A short description about the Oracle Siebel CRM Tool

## What is CRM and Why ?
CRM is an Customer Relationship mangement, it primarly goal to increase customer loyalty and in turn improve business profitability.
Now-a-days 70% of the web application holds a CRM tool in defining the architecture of an application.

## Why to relay on CRM as purpose is also serving by middle-ware technologies ?
Below are the main important points, why we are using CRM tools :
1. An application integrated with CRM, it will mostly relay to write the logic only in CRM not in middle ware.
2. Middle ware will be only used to serve the need to process the files in CRM Understandable Languages.
3. Siebel CRM accepts the data in XML and json requests not as a file.
4. Middle ware like java,.net,python are used to tansfer the files into XML or json and transfer it to CRM.
5. Added advantage of CRM is, it handles the logics requried by the client and provide an separate interface to the customer representive    to serve the custmoer needs.

## Siebel CRM Architecture :

Siebel CRM is a three layered Architecture as below :

> [User Interface Layer](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B40099_02/books/ConfigApps/ConfigApps_OverviewArch5.html)

> [Business Layer](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B40099_02/books/ConfigApps/ConfigApps_OverviewArch6.html)

> [Data Layer](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B40099_02/books/ConfigApps/ConfigApps_OverviewArch7.html)

As every application has three layer Architecture, Siebel itself conatins an three-layered architeucture.

> User interface will be responsable of creating and designing an beautiful UI by using HTML,CSS files.

> Business layer is where the whole logic will be handled by using the javascript language.

> Data Layer handles the data of the customer's and store in the oracle database.

Siebel CRM has a large domain over the Loyalty providing it to the customers.But slowly started losing its market now a days as many more CRM's like salesforce came into picture and all the data is stored in the cloud but not with the siebel still its using manual servers to store the code.
